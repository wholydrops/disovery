          Fungi are medicinal because they affect our nutrition, metabolism, and
          immunity. Mushrooms and fungi could activate many aspects of our
          immune response, whose fundamental purpose is to protect us from
          pathogenic types of viruses and bacteria.

        <p>
          Fungi interact with our body to activate global immune responses, help
          calm our nervous system, benefit our cardiovascular system, and
          protect us from toxins and stresses in our environment, all the while
          supplying important nutrients.

          Medicinal fungi can be powerful allies when used as part of a total
          program for health. Because medicinal fungi are so safe, they are well
          worth adding to any healing program; they are extremely helpful for
          increasing and activating the immune response against pathogens,
          perhaps even fighting cancer, as well as relieving the side effects of
          conventional cancer treatments such as chemotherapy.

          Some of the components that make up the fiber in fungi help modulate
          the immune system — the fiber in the cell walls of all fungi is partly
          composed of glucans, which are long chains of glucose molecules (and a
          type of polysaccharide) that are often indigestible to humans. This
          includes insoluble and soluble branched beta-glucans, branched
          alpha-glucans, and chitin; these are “prebiotics” that are not
          digested and absorbed from the upper digestive tract but make it down
          mostly intact to the colon to feed beneficial bacteria. <br />This is
          why we recommend shaking the bottle well before use.

          Research over the last few decades, and especially in the past 5 to 10
          years, has clearly shown the significant effect fungal beta-­glucans
          have on the immune system — for cancer treatment; to increase our
          resistance to viral, bacterial, and even fungal infections; and for
          restoration of damaged bone marrow, where immune stem cells that can
          replenish and “reboot” our immune system are produced.
        </p>
        <p>
          A tremendous worldwide research effort has demonstrated that fungal
          beta-glucans work as an immunomodulating agent through the activation
          of innate immune cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells,
          granulocytes, and natural killer cells.

          A mushroom tincture is a concentrated liquid extract that's made by
          soaking dried mushrooms, from a variety of mushroom species, such as
          reishi, lion's mane, and chaga in a solvent—typically alcohol and/or
          water. This process unlocks the active ingredients in the mushrooms,
          leaving you with a potent liquid that can be dosed with a pipette.
        </p>
        <p>
          The beneficial compounds from the mushrooms such as beta-glucans,
          polysaccharides, and triterpenoids that support immune function,
          cognitive health, and overall wellbeing are concentrated into the
          tincture.

          In order to access the active compounds in fungal cell walls, we must
          heat mushrooms before consuming them. Alcohol is a great solvent for
          extracting and preserving the low-molecular-weight compounds such as
          the diterpenes in lion’s mane and the triterpenes in reishi.

          For over five thousand years, mushrooms have been used as an effective
          medicine. Now, researchers are rediscovering the amazing value of
          these traditional medicinals as well as uncovering new
          benefits--benefits that can safely and naturally improve your health
          and well-being.

        <p>
          Tinctures are handy to carry and have a long shelf life. And because
          tincturing is a cold-extraction process, it captures somewhat more of
          the low-molecular-­weight active molecules — diterpenes, triterpenes,
          and phenolic compounds such as antioxidants.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our goal is to make a portable, shelf-stable product that captures the
          diterpenes in lion’s mane for nervous system and mood benefits, or the
          triterpenes in reishi to support the respiratory tract and nervous
          system.

          Medicinal mushrooms can be consumed regularly for a very long time —
          up to two years or more. Although there is no clinical research to
          support the idea that the immune system “habituates” or adjusts to
          mushrooms (thereby reducing their efficacy), common sense dictates
          that it could be beneficial to switch species every few months so the
          body is exposed to beta-glucans with varying structures — especially
          if the original supplement appears to be less effective over time. For
          example, if you use turkey tails or reishi, switch to shiitake,
          maitake, chaga, lion’s mane, agaricus because they offer different
          immunologically active compounds, such as structurally different
          beta-glucans, that could affect your immune response in different
          ways.

          However, considering all the many factors outside of our control that
          influence our health and the progression of disease, it’s unwise to
          think of any remedy as a magic bullet. Taking a variety of different
          treatments, undergoing counseling, and following new health habits
          create a series of complex interactions that would be difficult for
          any single therapy to address completely. Cancer, for example, is a
          set of complex metabolic diseases, and the response by our immune
          system to any disease is equally complex. This is something to keep in
          mind when considering the advertising claims of commercial products.
