                    <p class="font-small">In 2019, our interest in herbalism and natural health led us to begin researching how people have used fungi for healing and health in different cultures around the world. We also started combing the scientific literature for studies that might show the ways in which fungi affect our nutrition, metabolism, and immunity. This latter idea really struck us. </p>

                <p>Mushrooms and fungi could activate many aspects of our immune response, whose fundamental purpose is to protect us from pathogenic types of viruses and bacteria. According to traditional Chinese medicine, disease-promoting factors are created in our bodies through our constitution, diet, and metabolism, as well as external influences from the environment like hot, cold, dry, and damp. To the ancients, fungi like reishi could help remove these pathogens and restore healthy balance throughout our body’s systems, enabling us to maintain homeostasis.</p>

                <p>fungi have been around for about 1 billion years, according to a recent discovery based on fossils collected in northern Canada by an international team of researchers.1 The previous estimate was about 460 million years. This research shows that fungi appeared on land prior to the evolution of flowering plants, prior to the rise of insects, and long before the evolution of mammals. Other research shows that our distant ancestors were interacting with fungi. It’s no wonder, then, that we have developed sensors throughout our body to detect the presence of fungi!</p>

                <p>Currently, the published scientific literature on turkey tail fungus alone is likely to rival all the combined literature that existed in 1985 on all species of fungi used for medicine by all world cultures. In 1985, about 70 studies were published based on the keywords “medicinal mushrooms” in the scientific literature. By 2019, that had grown to about 4,400.</p>

                <p>A mushroom tincture is a concentrated liquid extract that's made by soaking dried mushrooms, from a variety of mushroom species, including reishi, lion's mane, and chaga in a solvent—typically alcohol and/or water. This process unlocks the active ingredients in the mushrooms, leaving you with a potent liquid that can be dosed with a pipette. The beneficial compounds from the mushrooms such as beta-glucans, polysaccharides, and triterpenoids that support immune function, cognitive health, and overall wellbeing are concentrated into the tincture. </p>
